        <h1>Background of the document</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This document addresses a technical frame of reference concerning the development progress of the Class
            Manager project
            web site. Main topics referenced in this report include modeling of the application emphasizing the server
            side, database
            and clients request handling.
        </p>
        <h2>Scope and Objectives</h2>
        <p>
            The main goal was for the project web site to act as the main communication tool between teachers and their
            students. For
            this reason, the site has been designed with the following in mind:
        <ul>
            <li>Be simple and easy to use</li>
            <li>As informative as possible for both parties involved</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Project’s requirements</h2>
        <p>
            Creating a utility for the management of students. The web solution provides:
        <ul>
            <li>Students will have the opportunity to upload some documents that must be graded by the teacher and to
                see
                the grades
                proposed by him.</li>
            <li>Teachers can accept students in a certain group or they can refuse it, they can put notes
                associated with various
                topics or for listening.</li>
            <li>Teachers can generate a code that will be used to make the presence (code that will expire after a
                predetermined period of
                10 minutes).</li>
            <li>Teachers can put a (predetermined) number of grades (same for all students, maximum 5) and to use a
                mathematical formula
                that uses basic operators (minimum: +, -, *, /, round, floor, others) to calculate a final grade.</li>
            <li>Teachers will have the opportunity to generate a catalog that can be exported in any of the CSV, HTML or
                PDF formats.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Design and Implementation Constraints</h1>
        <h2>Application architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The architecture is inspired by the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model. MVC is an architectural model used in
            software
            engineering. The success of the model is due isolating the business logic from the resulting user
            interface, considering
            an application where the visual appearance and/or the lower levels of the rules of businesses are easier to
            modify
            without affecting other levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore from the application design point of view, the REST (Representational state transfer) API was
            integrated.
            The motivation behind it is that API works as a mediator between the users or clients and the resources or
            web
            services
            they want to get. It’s also a way for an organization to share resources and information while maintaining
            security,
            control, and authentication, determining who gets access to what.
        </p>
        <h2>Server</h2>
        <p>
            The server side of the application provides a simple static file server built with pure Node.js, which is
            also
            responsible with handling dynamic requests from clients. The policy of the server consists of verifying the
            received
            URL from the client’s request.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to process a client’s dynamic request, the URL must meet the required standard, by starting
            with ”/api”.
            Before sending the request further to the controller, the server certifies if there is an available valid
            cookie
            associated with the client.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other part of the server deals with loading folder content as file server.The logic is to look for the
            extension of
            the file being requested and see if it matches with one of the specified MIME types. Lastly, we respond to
            the client with the file information by reading the file from the system. If the URL does not specify a
            file,
            the client is
            redirected to the web site’s landing page.
        </p>
        <h2>Routing</h2>
        <p>
            Any request made by the client which is not static is sent to the router of the application. Once the
            request
            is received
            from the server side it is further delegated to the router for managing. Once it gets to the routing phase,
            the HTTP
            request method is checked and the router parses the URL to facilitate the ease of handling the parameters.
            Each dynamic
            route is associated with a controller method responsible of handling the request appropriately.
        </p>
        <h2>Database</h2>
        <p>
            For the database management of the web site application, a relational database was used, backed by
            PostgreSQL.
            The database
            consist of 9 tables :
            <br>
            <img class="databaseDiagram" alt="databaseDiagram" src="../others/ClaMa_DB.png">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Users</b> : encapsulates information about all clients that own an account on the web site. Each user
                can
                authenticate into
                their account by email or username, both unique for any user, along with the password. Other
                detailsretained about the
                user are: first name, last name and the user’s type(studentor teacher)</li>
            <li><b>Classes</b>: encapsulates information about any teacher’s classes such as the title of the class,
                schedule,
                links to their
                personal site or to other platforms</li>
            <li><b>Userclasses</b> : representing the junction between users and the classes, more explicitly which
                classes are
                attended by
                student and which classes are owned by teachers</li>
            <li><b>Assignments</b>: encapsulates informations about assignments given by teachers such as who posted the
                assignment,
                the creation date
                and when it’s due along with other useful information entered by the author (files, details regarding
                the
                assignment)</li>
            <li><b>Studentsassignments</b>: detains assignments turned in by students, includinga message and/or files
            </li>
            <li><b>Usersattendance</b> : owns data regarding students that need to validate their presence in class
                using the
                given code by the
                teacher. The purpose of the table is to retain the student’s identity along with the timestamp of the
                moment when they
                tried to validate their presence</li>
            <li><b>Catalog</b>: encapsulates information about each class’s students such as number of presences, and
                their
                grade assigned by
                the teacher’s class</li>
            <li><b>Classesrequests</b>: contains students request to sign up to specific classes</li>
            <li><b>News</b>: encapsulates informations about any teacher’s posts from their classes that are addressed
                to their
                students,
                containing files or other useful information</li>

        <h1>Client interaction</h1>
        <p>
            The client-server communication occurs via RESTful API services. When a client request is made, it transfers
            a
            representation of the state of the resource to the endpoint. This information, or representation, is
            delivered
            in the JSON(Javascript Object Notation) format via HTTP.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each client is uniquely identified with a cookie which is generated at the authentication phase and sent
            back
            to the
            client as response. The cookie is used as an identifier, used by the server to properly manage its clients.
            The
            cookie encompasses a json web token which holds the client’s identity by using their database id along with
            the type of
            the account they own in order to manage their requests accordingly. The cookie is being sent back and forth
            during
            the interaction by the client’s requests header (which makes it http secure) and is available for a day or
            until logout
            action is performed, when the cookie is destroyed.
        </p>

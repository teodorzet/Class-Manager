    <section id="studentInterface" property="schema:description">
        <h1>Student’s point of view</h1>
        <h2>Homepage</h2>
        <p>
            After authentication the student is redirected to their personal work-space containing all of the classes
            they are
            attending.
        </p>
        <p>
            Above the section of the courses they’re signed up to, a student can enter any valid id of a class in order
            to send their
            teacher a request to sign up, which requires teacher’s approval
        </p>
        <h2>Course Page</h2>
        <p>
            After selecting any of the courses, the student is redirected to its dedicated page containing all necessary
            information
            regarding the course along with the grades they obtained. Other than that, a student can find latest
            teacher’s post and
            assignments considering the specific topic involved and download the attachments if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The students will mark their presence to class by entering a valid code received from their teacher.
        </p>
        <img class="image" alt="presence" src="../others/markAsPresent.png">
        <h2>Assignments</h2>
        <p>
            A student can access their assignments by either entering the course page or the ”Assignments” section. This
            page
            contains all
            student’s assignments (from all classes they’re taking) which can be viewed in a sorted manner by choosing
            from the drop
            down an option.
        </p>
        <img class="image" alt="assignmentsDropdown" src="../others/dropdown.png">
        <p>
            After selecting one of the assignments the student meets an area where they can upload useful files
            regarding
            their work
            and submitting them, by pressing the submit button, in order to get graded.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="teacherInterface" property="schema:description">
        <h1>Teacher’s point of view</h1>
        <h2>Homepage</h2>
        <p>
            After authentication the teacher is redirected to their personal work-space containing all of the
            classes they
            are owning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Above the section of the courses they’re teaching, a teacher can create a new class by filling a form
            requesting
            information
            about the new class.
        </p>
        <h2>Creating new class</h2>
        <p>
            In the homepage, the teacher can press the ”plus” button below the navigation bar. Therefore, they are sent
            to a form
            requiring the new class information.
        </p>
        <img class="image" alt="newClass" src="../others/newClass.png">
        <p>
            The teacher must provide information describing the class. The fields ”Classlink” refers to the teacher’s
            personal web
            site and ”Other platforms” refers to other platforms that are going to be used along the course’s progress.
            It
            is recommended to fill these fields with useful links, but not necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            ”Number of components” demands the number of grades that are going to be assigned to the students along the
            course
            as they
            participate, the maximum number being 5.
        </p>
        <p>
            ”Formula” demands a mathematical formula that is going to be used for computing the students final grades.
            This formula
            must meet an imposed standard for it to be accepted by the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on how many components the teacher chooses, the formula must contain the same amount of variables,
            nothing
            more, nothing less. Another detail to remember is that the variables must be the first ’x’ letters of
            the alphabet, where
            x represents the number of components chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an example : Let’s say a teacher chooses 3 components. A valid formula would look something like this :
            (a+b+c)/3 or
            (a*0.3+b*0.7)/c, etc. Any formula containing something else other then a, b or c in this case will make the
            formula
            invalid and therefore the creation of class will not pass.
        </p>
        <h2>Course Page</h2>
        <p>
            After selecting any of the courses, the teacher is redirected to its dedicated page containing all necessary
            information
            regarding the course along with the class id which will be used by students to send sign up requests to
            class
            and a
            presence code which will be used by students for presence validation. The presence code can be generated by
            pressing the
            ”Start Class” button inside the panel area.This action’s result ends in creating a new random code whose
            validity lasts
            for 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <img class="image" alt="coursePage" src="../others/coursePage.png">
        <p>
            "Catalog” button redirects the teacher to the catalog of the class containing the students following the
            course along with
            their grades that can be modified by clicking and entering them in the fields. Changes will not be taken
            into consideration if the ”save” button is not pressed. In this page, you will also find 3 more buttons,
            which are 3 different types of export (CSV, HTML or PDF) of the catalog you are looking at.
        </p>
        <p>
            ”Assignment” button redirects the teacher to a new form for creating an assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            ”Edit class” button redirects the teacher to a form for updating the current course information.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the panel area the teacher can create posts for their students and add attachments to it if wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than that, the teacher can find a hierarchy of all of the posts and assignments they created.
        </p>
        <h2>View Students Assignments</h2>
        <p>
            In the bottom of the Course’s page the teacher can find a section with all of the assignments they ever
            posted. By
            selecting any of them, they are redirected to a new page where they can view their students work and
            download
            their
            files by clicking the box associated with the turned in assignment.
